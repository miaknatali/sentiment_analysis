Thanks   The channel: \", 'Proposed data center in Chantilly stirs up controversy ahead of community meeting The applicant also wants a special exception to increase the allowed height of the data center from 75 feet to 110 feet, arguing that the added height is necessary to accommodate rooftop equipment and screening.  The data center option would include 50 parking spaces to the south of the three-story building, four loading spaces, and an 8-foot-tall security fence within the outside of an environmentally sensitive area.  The second option for a warehouse would include 150 parking spaces, a loading dock with 30 spaces, trailer parking, and a stormwater bio-retention area. The applicant would also pursue LEED green building certification for the warehouse.  &amp;#x200B;  ', 'Microsoft acquires 14-acre site in Sterling for data centers Citing Loudoun County property records, [BizJournal reports] Microsoft acquired a 14-acre parcel at 23540 Pebble Run Place for a little over $15 million last month.

I feel like I hear lots of whining from Loudon residents about the number of data centers in the county. And like yeah I get it, they are large, featureless warehouses that are pretty boring to look at.  But at the same time, they are large, featureless, relatively quiet, warehouses that don't emit a bunch of crap or smell terrible. And they generate a TON of tax revenue. In 2023 Loudon's set to make $576 million off of 115 data centers, basically every one of these boring beige buildings makes the county $5 million a year just sitting there. That's a \\\\*third\\\\* of all property tax revenue in the county.  Am I wrong to think its pretty privileged to complain about these? I think there are lots of poor communities in the country who would be insanely stoked to make $5 million a year off of essentially a big warehouse. I'm guessing the electrical/AC/Technical requirements of the Data centers drive a ton of jobs out to Loudon too, and that's not even considering how much AWS/Microsoft are probably paying to have offices close to them.  I get that they're boring, but like compared to the hassle of living next to a mine/factory/coal plant, aren't they....pretty awesome?\", \"Need help with sources and talking points AGAINST the development of a data center adjacent to a neighborhood.

McKay said this process is designed to steer data centers into places that are most appropriate and make sure standards are set for environmental protections, noise mitigation and other issues that have people concerned.

For the past three years, my internet has constantly dropped. Random times during the day, late at night, no pattern, no fix. I\\'ve spent hundreds of dollars on new wiring, equipment, and everything is hardlined. I don’t even use Wi-Fi.  I used to work in datacenter networking. I\\'m not new to this. I wrote custom tooling to track and graph the connection drops with timestamps and packet loss data. I submitted everything to Comcast.  The first time I got fed up, I filed an FCC complaint. Comcast responded with “we investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong, try resetting your Wi-Fi router.” Again, I don’t own a Wi-Fi router.  Eventually someone from their so-called \"customer experience\" team called and emailed me. They barely tried to schedule a tech visit, then ghosted me, and later claimed they attempted contact. I submitted another complaint showing proof that they were lying about following up. If they can lie about something that simple, why should we trust that they did any kind of actual investigation?  I\\'ve had techs come out before filing. They stall and run the same basic fiber tests every time. I already own the same tools and have run the same diagnostics. Nothing changes.  I rely on the internet for my livelihood. I\\'m a software engineer. I need stable internet for video calls, running builds on my local server, remote access, everything. And I can\\'t just move. I’m locked in a lease and I need to stay close to my mom.  After three FCC complaints, I still have no recourse. Comcast controls the entire market here, and the City of Arlington seems perfectly fine with it. It\\'s exhausting.

The only people that really benefit from DC's as I see it are the power companies and the telcos that benefit from their bandwidth requirements.  Considering the massive size of the buildings, the # of employees they bring is very low.. and with the state incentives I'd guess they dont pay much in taxes.
