Meanwhile, I have to compete not only with my own team, but employees at our worksite under a different manager. I'm a contract to hireemployee, so I'm lowest on the totem pole, and I just feel overwhelmed. I was prepared to be laid off at my last job (contract/temp job) but it still took me a month to find a new one. I'm barely paying my bills and my debt off while getting paid more for working the night shift. I'm taking up a second job at a gas station, but who knows if or how much it will affect my performance at my main job. I just feel like so much of my problems and stress would be solved if I wasn't constantly worried about survival. I worked my way up into IT, and the fact I'm still struggling with how much my career has progressed makes. the thought of being unemployed or having to take a lower paying job even more stressful.
